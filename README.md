## Vehiculum Coding Challenge

## General workflow

https://vehiculum-frontend.vercel.app/

1. Using Next.js version 13 (newest)
2. Home-page (search results) will include the car-color and the car-makes (Marken).

3. Using Server Side Rendering (best with Next.js), a massive benefit, to pre-build the pages on the server (per-request) and deliver it to the user faster. It also better for SEO performance.

4. Car-detail page is using getStaticPaths, getStaticProps, yet again, for best performance.

5. Images are set at quality of 80% even tough images are not large in size.

6. Tailwinds: integrated theme Extend and custom classes/selectors e.g gridTemplate.

7. Using the Next.js Layout and Slug.

8. Custom 404 page.

9. Features utilities (functions).

10. React Slider including thumbnails.

11. Custom Module classes (Sass) styles.

## Extending Solution

3. Dynamic headers (SEO performance)
4. Serve app via NodeJS Server (RESTful API)
